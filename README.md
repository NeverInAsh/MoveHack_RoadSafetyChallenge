# MoveHack_RoadSafetyChallenge
Team Members: Anshik & Jitendra

Objective:
Developed a Ensemble Tree Based Machine Learning Model to predict driver behaviour and alarm type.

Results:
1. Driver Behaviour: Achieved 0.965 F1 score on 30% Test Data [train-mlogloss:0.049132 test-mlogloss:0.099957 using Cross Validation]
2. Alarm Type: Achieved 0.99 F1 Score on 30% Test Data [train-mlogloss:0.00022	test-mlogloss:0.002045 using Cross Validation]

*Scripts folder includes .py/.ipynb/.pkl files for both driver behaviour and alarm type
